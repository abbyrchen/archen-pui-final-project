# **FP2 \- Evaluation of the Final project**

## Project Description

My motivation is to transform my personal portfolio from a static, basic project showcase into a dynamic reflection of my creativity and design capabilities. I aim to craft a unique, visually engaging site that represents my aesthetic and skills, while also building it from scratch to have full control over updates and customizations. By coding it myself, I’m creating a flexible portfolio I can continue to develop and use throughout my career post-graduation.

## High-Fi Prototypes

### *Prototype 1*

![Swiping Project View](images/card_swiping_prototype)
![Project Cards](images/project_cards_test)
![Card Swiping](images/card_swiping)

Link: https://www.figma.com/proto/NJSHsJ1qLCIekYpe1ys8fi/05-430-final-project?node-id=54-19506&node-type=frame&viewport=691%2C268%2C0.08&t=sZPAxkr9Aqx9EQGJ-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=54%3A19506&show-proto-sidebar=1

Overall, all the users I interviewed preferred this portfolio version. They found the project swipe-on-scroll feature visually engaging, describing it as 'cool' and 'interesting.' They recommended a project count indicator (e.g., 1/5) for navigation. While I couldn't replicate the exact interaction in Figma as I'd plan to code it, I explained this to users after testing. They responded positively to the idea of scrolling to move through projects instead of dragging, which the prototype currently requires.

### *Prototype 2*

![Horizontal Scroll View](images/horizontal_scroll_prototype)

Link: https://www.figma.com/proto/NJSHsJ1qLCIekYpe1ys8fi/05-430-final-project?node-id=54-18400&node-type=frame&viewport=691%2C268%2C0.08&t=sZPAxkr9Aqx9EQGJ-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=54%3A18400&show-proto-sidebar=1

Users liked the horizontal scroll but wanted an indicator showing the number of projects. One user didn’t realize more projects were available and tried to drag the project, suggesting a clearer cue for horizontal scrolling is needed. I couldn’t replicate my idea of showing projects in black and white that turn to color on scroll in the prototype, but it’s a feature I plan to include on the final site.

## Usability Test

During usability testing, I gathered insightful feedback that guided improvements and inspired new directions for my portfolio’s design. One useful suggestion was to add an indicator showing the current project out of the total number. A user expressed that this would help them track their progress as they navigate the projects. Implementing this feature provides users with a sense of orientation, enhancing the overall navigation experience.

Another comment was to adjust the card orientation and avoid the layered layout. Although the Figma prototype required dragging due to software limitations, I plan to have projects move based on scrolling in the developed version. Additionally, this user experienced a restart issue where dragging would take them back to the top of the site. This was specific to the prototype and highlighted the importance of preventing similar disruptions in the final coded version.

The user also suggested increasing interactivity with elements that slide in, like images or text, to enhance visual appeal. If time permits after implementing the main features, I’ll add these interactions to sections like the "About" page for a richer user experience. Another suggestion was to expand the footer with more detailed contact information. To address this, I’ll add links and additional options, making the footer more informative.

Feedback also identified navigation issues, such as the resume link not working. I will link it to a downloadable PDF of my resume in the final version. Lastly, a user suggested adding a subtle effect to the homepage’s caret icon. I plan to implement a fade-out effect as the user scrolls down, with the caret reappearing upon scrolling back up, adding polish and interactivity.

In summary, user feedback was instrumental in refining my design by improving navigation, adding interactivity, and ensuring a user-centered approach to the final portfolio layout.

## Updated Designs

![Updated Footer](images/updated_footer)

Video Prototype:
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ff6ff47-dbdf-4271-a9b7-30ba520dd1c7

The main updates to the prototype included adding a visual indicator showing the current project’s position within the sequence and enhancing the footer with contact information like LinkedIn, email, and Instagram to improve accessibility. For the final developed site, I’ll also adjust the interaction to enable smooth scrolling rather than swiping and incorporate microinteractions to make the user experience more engaging and responsive.

## Feedback Summary

Although I couldn’t attend the lab session for feedback, I scheduled an individual meeting with my TA, Cella, to discuss my revised project idea. This meeting was invaluable, as it provided some feedback on my initial prototypes, particularly the horizontal scroll interaction, which Cella noted didn’t feel intuitive for users. Although I ultimately chose not to use that design, her insights made me more mindful of creating clear, user-friendly interactions. This reflection led me to rethink the card swiping interaction, ensuring that it felt natural and guided users effectively.

In addition to my TA’s feedback, I conducted extra rounds of user testing to gather broader insights into the design’s usability and effectiveness. During these sessions, I interviewed eight users, each offering unique perspectives and suggestions. For example, users recommended adding a clear indicator for navigating between projects, ensuring they felt oriented and aware of their position within the portfolio. They also suggested more dynamic interactions, like subtle animations, to make the portfolio visually engaging.

Overall, this combination of feedback sessions and user testing significantly influenced the final design. The process highlighted the importance of balancing creativity with intuitive design elements, ensuring each interaction felt seamless.

### *Libraries and Other Components*

List the JS libraries and other components (if applicable) that you plan to use. 
* WebGL
* GSAP
* ScrollTrigger
* React

## Generative AI Use Plan

Outline how you plan to use Generative AI tools to aid in the implementation.

### *Tool Use*

 What would you use? Edit the list given your plan. For each tool, explain briefly on what do you expect Generative AI to help you with and what might it not be able to help you with.

* ChatGPT  
  * I will use ChatGPT for coding assistance and specific troubleshooting, especially for areas involving complex logic or less familiar concepts, like vector math and WebGL implementation. ChatGPT will be helpful for debugging when I encounter issues in my WebGL effects or need help fine-tuning the spinning graphic on my "About" page. 
  * I will not use it for setting up my basic framework and the foundational structure of the site. I want to build these components myself to have full control over the design and understand every part of my codebase. Additionally, I won’t use it for creative decisions, such as the design of interactive elements on the "Play" or "About" pages, as I want to develop those ideas independently.
* GitHub Copilot  
  * I will use GitHub Copilot if I encounter challenges in complex state updates. I want to use React for my project, and while I am mostly confident I can do this myself, if I come across challenges integrating it with all the complex interactions involved, I will use Copilot for some help.
  * I will not rely on Copilot for intricate design logic or WebGL-specific code, as I plan to customize these aspects fully and refine the interaction dynamics on my own.


### *Responsible Use*

How would you use Generative AI responsibly? 

I aim to use Generative AI tools responsibly by leveraging them as assistants rather than primary creators. My approach is to experiment and solve issues independently first, turning to AI only for complex debugging or areas outside my current expertise, like WebGL physics or vector math. Additionally, by only using AI for code assistance on components that don’t impact the core interactive design, I maintain full creative control while building essential technical skills. This approach ensures that the final product reflects my unique design vision and personal effort, making AI a supplementary, rather than primary, part of my creative process.

# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1*

![Personal Portfolio](images/personal_portfolio)

My first idea for my final project is to create an immersive 3D navigable portfolio that demonstrates my design skills, my aesthetic, and my interests. My current portfolio is basic and communicates my projects but I'd like to create one that demonstrates my programming skills along with my creativity. I plan to put a heavy focus on visual design, interactions, and animations. Viewers can see my "Abbyverse" and enter different islands/structures to learn different things about me-- from my UX work to fashion to hobbies. I want this website to be a visual experience that emphasizes exploration throughout the site. This design will be accessible because keyboard controls can be used to navigate between 'islands' , the images will have alt text, and I'm contemplating the idea of having an alternative that lists the information on the site as a simple list. In terms of information on the site, I want to include my Lunar Gala/fashion experience, my hobbies (staying active, volleyball), traveling, UX design projects, graphic design/other artwork.

### *Idea 2*

![Runway Archive](images/runway_archive)

My second idea for my final project is to create a visually appealing, swipeable archive that presents designers’ runway collections across different seasons. Current sites/apps that do this don't have an interface that matches with high-fashion and are usually hard to use. Again with this idea, I want to create a visual experience that exudes high-fashion. My design will be interactive because users can swipe through different seasons and click in to view certain collections and their looks. It will be accessible with alt text and keyboard controls.

### *Idea 3*

![Book Tracker](images/book_tracker)

My last idea for my final project is to design a digital bookshelf where users can log their reading progress and books, view their own reviews, and customize the interface to reflect the mood of each book. Users view their bookshelf on their homescreen and can click on a book to open it. From there, they can add text reviews, update progress, write ratings, and change the background of the screen to represent the mood of the book. Additionally, users can add new books. This design will be engaging with a modern interface and animations to open the book and add more books.

## Feedback Summary

For my first project idea, a 3D metaverse portfolio, the main critiques focused on accessibility and navigation. Given the potential complexity of 3D art and limited text elements, users might find it challenging to navigate without clear guidance. 

The second idea involves showcasing curated collections or designers. Feedback here emphasized the importance of narrowing down the scope to keep the content focused and manageable. My classmates suggested highlighting a few key collections or designers, allowing users to dive deeper into specific areas. One also recommended using the Swiper library for smoother transitions between items. They noted the importance of defining an optimal screen size early on as this would influence which animation libraries best support the design’s visual flow.

My third idea, a customizable digital bookshelf, received the most positive feedback. This concept would allow users to share their reading progress, reviews, ratings, and moods with friends, possibly by integrating with StoryGraph. Technical questions included which API would be best and whether book covers should load automatically or be added manually by users. Classmates liked that this idea has room for creativity with personalization options, animations, and customization possibilities, making it highly engaging for users.

## Feedback Digestion

Overall, I received strong feedback on each project, along with ideas for further development. Following the session, I realized accessibility could be a concern with the 3D metaverse portfolio, so I brainstormed solutions like incorporating keyboard controls and adding a simplified, alternative view that lists the website's information. I also thought about enhancing navigation: users could click on individual islands, return to a central homepage for an overall view, or move between islands using on-screen arrows.

For the runway archive project, my classmates suggested libraries that could streamline swipe interactions, especially Swiper. I was initially concerned about the project’s scope, but feedback to focus on specific designers or collections provided a helpful direction. I also briefly considered including a feature to save looks to add complexity, but feedback suggested this would be unnecessary.

For my third idea, a customizable digital bookshelf, I really liked the suggestion to add a social feature where users could share books, progress, reviews, and mood. This led to a discussion on APIs, where GoodReads was suggested initially, though a classmate noted it is no longer publicly accessible. I’m now researching alternative APIs, as integrating one seems important for the project’s functionality.
